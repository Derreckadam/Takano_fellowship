abstract: |
  This report describes Veterans and thier needs in Southern California and how they differ from the greater united states. To analyze these questions the report utilizes many sources of data from the US Census Buerea, Veteran Affairs data, map data, and transit data from the following districts: 36, 42, 41, 31, 35, 8, 27, 45, and 39. In this over ten million hectare area (1/4 the size of california) there are approximately  280,000 veterans with ten clinics. In general this report finds that despite having the largest Veteran population of any state it does not have A.) High Quality VA Clinics and Medical Centers and B.) Clinics that are accessilbe by much of the population.

# Southern California Veteran Overview

Much of Southern California is desert and as such has very dispersed veteran populations (figure 1). In addition there are different branches due to other geographic features such as coastal access for the Navy, air force bases, training bases. Many people (approxamately 2.6 million in the last 10 years) are moving into California including veterans [Source: World population]

## History

In 1888 the LA West Campus was gifted to the Federal Government. It was under scruteny for corruption and mismangement with lead to the creation of the "Master Plan" [Everything You Need To Know About The Massive, Decaying West LA VA Campus — And The Plan To Fix It.] bringing in more housing for Veterans and reducing the Veteran Homeless Population in LA [LA’s Veteran Homelessness down 18 Percent]. The plan also revitalizes the medical facilities however cuts the PTSD clinic [The VA Wants to Move a PTSD Clinic. The Vets Are Fighting Back].

In the 1970's the current VA's were established around Riverside. Jerry Lewis, Rep for Redlands, was on the appropriations committee. Now as desert community populations are growing there is a need for clinics further east.

## Veteran Population in Southern California

Analyzed districts include 36, 42, 41, 31, 35, 8, 27, 45, and 39 chosen based on a 10 mile distance of the perimeter of District 41. There are nearly 30,000 veterans making up about 5% of the population in District 41 alone. Currently there is no VA clinic in Riverside and the nearest one, in Corona, is about a two hour bus ride.


This analysis assigned census tracks (neighborhoods) a value of veterans and then output a circle corresponding to the number of veterans in that area.

The next analysis used VA facilities in southern california as reference points, then using traffic data (monday 8:00) mapped out the furthest a driver could go in the given time constraints, 10min, 20min, 45min, and 1hr. The darker the area the shorter the drive to a VA clinic.

Each veteran assessed from track data was assigned to the district in which they belong. These values were summed up and are presented as high to low values (Red to Yellow)

## Demographics

This data is the US census data from 2013 to 2017 showing current breakdown of Veteran Population by Race, War Participation, and Education.


### Race

This heatmap shows various races claimed by veterans in census data, this data is overlayed onto District data. Composition of each district can be analyzed based on heat (red is high populations yellow is low)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

demo <- read_excel("Data.xlsx", sheet = "Vet_Census_Demo")
demo.m <- melt(demo, id = c("Race",	"District",	"Veteran Total",	"Veteran Total Error"))
demo.m$District <- as.character(demo.m$District)

#demo.plot <- ggplot(demo.m, aes(x=District, y=Race, size="Veteran Total", fill="District")) + geom_jitter(aes(size = demo.m$`Veteran Total`, colour = demo.m$District), alpha=.5) + scale_size(range = c(0,5)) + theme_bw()

Demo.heat <- ggplot(demo.m, aes(demo.m$District, demo.m$Race)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = demo.m$`Veteran Total`), colour = "white") + scale_fill_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "red", name="Number of Veterans") + ylab("Race") + xlab("District")

```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7,fig.height=4,fig.cap="this figure shows the population of Veterans in District 41 and surrounding districts",fig.pos = "H"}
Demo.heat
```


### War Participation


This analysis shows the various campaigns in which the veterans in southern california have been involved. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

War <- read_excel("Data.xlsx", sheet = "B21002", range= "A2:C11")


```


### Education

This analysis shows the degree attainment of veterans as reported to US Census bureau



## Need for Transportation to make clinics accessible 

There are approxamately 60,000 disabled vets in District 41 and surrounding Districts. Here is a specific break down of veterans with disablities, senior status, and those living below the poverty line that might inhibit them from being able to drive a car. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}


income <- read_excel("Data.xlsx", sheet = "B21007")
income <- as.data.frame(income)

income.m <- melt(income, id = c("Age", "Disability", "District", "Population", "Margin of Error"))

# subset data and create new object based on column query
str(income.m$Disability)
income.dis <- income.m[income.m$Disability == "With a disability" ,]

dodge=position_dodge(width=.99)
p1 <- ggplot(income.dis, aes(x=District, y=income.dis$`Population`, fill=Age)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", alpha=0.9, position=dodge) + ylab("Number of Disabled Veterans") + geom_errorbar(position=dodge, aes(ymin=Population-income.dis$`Margin of Error`, ymax=Population+income.dis$`Margin of Error`), width=.1)


str(income.m$Age)
income.old <- income.m[income.m$Age == "65+ years" ,]

p2 <- ggplot(income.old, aes(x=District, y=income.old$`Population`, fill=income.old$District)) +
  geom_bar(stat= "identity") + ylab("Number of Veterans") + ggtitle("Senior Veterans Below Poverty Line") + theme(legend.position = "none")




pdf("demos.pdf")
p1
p2
dev.off()

```

### Disablities 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}


dis <- read_excel("Data.xlsx", sheet = "B21100")
dis.df <- as.data.frame(dis)

dis.m <- melt(dis.df, id = c("Variable",	"Percent Disability",	"District",	"Population"))

dis.plot <- ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(y = dis.df$Population, x = dis.df$`Percent Disability`, fill = dis.df$District), stat="identity") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Congressional District")) + ylab("Population") + xlab("Percent Service Connected Disability ")

pdf("displot.pdf", height=4, width=10)
dis.plot
dev.off()


```

This figure shows the distribution of the 60,000 disabled vets by their percent Service connected disablity


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=8,fig.height=6,fig.cap="This figure shows veterans with disablilities",fig.pos = "H"}
dis.plot
```

\pagebreak

This figure was analyzed using census data on veterans that indicated that their wages were below the poverty level 


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=8,fig.height=4,fig.cap="This figure shows disabled veterans living below the poverty line",fig.pos = "H"}
p1
```

\pagebreak


### Senior Status

This figure uses Census data and reports veterans 65 year and older. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}


age <- read_excel("Data.xlsx", sheet = "Seniors", range = "A1:C10")
age <- as.data.frame(age)

age.plot <- ggplot(age, aes(x=age$District, y=age$`Total Seniors`, fill=age$District)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + ylab("Number of Veterans over 65") + xlab("Congressional District") + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=age$`Total Seniors`-age$Error, ymax=age$`Total Seniors`+age$Error), width=.1) + theme(legend.position = "none")


pdf("age.pdf")
age.plot
dev.off()

```


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=8,fig.height=4,fig.cap="This figure shows senior veterans (65+ years old) living below the poverty line", fig.pos = "H"}
age.plot
```


This is a break down of the senior veterans that live below the poverty level in each district 


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=8,fig.height=4,fig.cap="This figure shows senior veterans (65+ years old) living below the poverty line", fig.pos = "H"}
p2
```

\pagebreak

### Income

In district 41 and surrounding districts thousands live below the poverty line, and as a result they may rely on public transporation to get them to VA clinics. 

This result shows employed and unemployed veterans living below the poverty level

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

VetOver <- read_excel("Data.xlsx", sheet = "Vet_census_age", range = "A1:D7")

## Mental Health in Riverside CA
  I'd like to include some data on veteran mental health health here. it would demonstrate the need for a loca facility but also help define what might be key roles for a new clinic. 
  


## Mobile Clinic Route

# Conclusion
Students here for UCR for veterans. Major bus route, 91, 215.


Ideal outcome: Winning contract for 5 CBOCs, over building one here. RFP
Hybrid, community owned, Va owned. CBOCs are lucrative
